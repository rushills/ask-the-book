The idea behind this concept is that if you start your day by completing the most difficult task, everything else will seem easier in comparison.

However, by facing it head-on and completing it early in the day, you can gain a sense of accomplishment and momentum that will carry you through the rest of your tasks.

## Setting clear goals


>Your ability to set clear, written goals, and then to work toward them every day, will do more to guarantee your success than any other single factor. [1]

In the book 'Eat That Frog' by Brian Tracy, he emphasizes the importance of setting clear goals in order to achieve success and overcome procrastination. Tracy suggests that by clearly defining your goals, you can create a roadmap for your actions and increase your motivation to take the necessary steps towards achieving them.

Setting clear goals involves a few important elements. First and foremost, it's crucial to be specific about what you want to achieve. Having vague or general goals can cause confusion and a lack of direction. By clearly defining your goals, you can concentrate your efforts and make them more achievable.

Secondly, Tracy emphasizes the importance of setting measurable goals. This means that your goals should be quantifiable, allowing you to track your progress and determine whether you are on the right track. Measurable goals provide a sense of accomplishment as you reach milestones along the way.

Additionally, setting realistic goals is crucial. While it is important to challenge yourself, setting goals that are too ambitious or unattainable can lead to frustration and demotivation. Tracy suggests breaking down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks, making them easier to achieve and maintain momentum.

In addition, it is important to set goals with specific timeframes. By giving your goals deadlines, you create a sense of urgency and avoid putting things off. Time-bound goals also assist in prioritizing tasks and managing your time and resources efficiently.

In "Eat That Frog," Tracy emphasizes the importance of writing down your goals. By putting your goals on paper, you make them tangible and increase your commitment to achieving them. Writing down your goals also allows you to review and revise them as needed, ensuring they remain relevant and aligned with your overall objectives.

## Overcoming procrastination


The author shares some really helpful insights and strategies on how to overcome procrastination. Procrastination is something that a lot of people struggle with, but Tracy provides practical advice that can really make a difference.

>The law of forced efficiency says that there is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing. [1]

Tracy emphasizes the importance of prioritization. He suggests that we should identify our most important tasks, or 'frogs,' and tackle them first thing in the morning. This helps us avoid procrastination and stay focused on completing important tasks promptly.

Tracy also highlights the significance of setting clear goals and creating a roadmap for achieving them. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, we can make progress and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This approach helps to build momentum and motivation, making it easier to overcome procrastination.

Another strategy Tracy suggests is the use of time management techniques, such as the Pomodoro Technique. This technique involves working in focused bursts of time, typically 25 minutes, followed by a short break. By working in short, concentrated intervals, we can increase productivity and reduce the likelihood of getting distracted or procrastinating.

Tracy also highlights the significance of self-discipline and building positive habits. He motivates readers to adopt a mindset of taking prompt action and resisting the urge to postpone tasks. Through consistent practice of self-discipline and the formation of productive habits, we can conquer procrastination and accomplish our goals more efficiently.
