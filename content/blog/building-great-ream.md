#### So, I asked the book how to build a great team and guess what it told me!

In "Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action," Simon Sinek emphasizes the importance of building a team that shares a common purpose, vision, and values. According to Sinek, a successful team is built around a strong "Why" â€“ the core belief that drives everything the team does. Here are some key steps to approach building a team according to the book:

1. Define your "Why": Before you start building your team, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of your organization's purpose, cause, or belief. This "Why" should be the foundation of your team and guide every decision you make.

2. Communicate your "Why": Make sure that your team members understand and believe in your "Why." Communicate it clearly and consistently, both internally and externally. This will help attract people who share your vision and values.

3. Hire for cultural fit: When recruiting new team members, prioritize cultural fit over skills and experience. Look for people who share your organization's values and are passionate about your "Why." Skills can be taught, but it's much harder to change someone's core beliefs.

4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where team members feel like they belong and are valued for their unique contributions. Encourage open communication, collaboration, and support among team members.

5. Empower your team: Give your team members the autonomy and resources they need to succeed. Trust them to make decisions and take ownership of their work. This will help them feel more invested in the organization's success and more motivated to contribute their best efforts.

6. Lead by example: As a leader, it's essential to embody your organization's "Why" and demonstrate your commitment to it through your actions. This will inspire your team members to follow suit and stay true to the shared vision.

7. Celebrate successes and learn from failures: Recognize and celebrate your team's achievements, both big and small. At the same time, be open to learning from mistakes and failures. This will help create a culture of continuous improvement and growth.

By following these steps, you can build a strong, cohesive team that is united by a shared purpose and driven to achieve great things together. [1]

>When we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn't drive behavior.

#### How to lead by example?

Sinek emphasizes the importance of understanding and communicating your "why" - the purpose, cause, or belief that drives you and your organization. Here are some key insights from the book that can help you lead by example:

1. Discover your own "why": Before you can lead others, it's essential to understand your own motivations and values. Reflect on what truly inspires and drives you, and articulate your purpose in a clear and compelling way.

2. Communicate your "why" consistently: Great leaders consistently communicate their "why" to their team members. By sharing your vision and values, you inspire others to align their actions with the greater purpose of the organization.

3. Set high standards: Leading by example means setting high standards for yourself and holding yourself accountable. Demonstrate the behaviors and values you expect from your team, and consistently strive for excellence.

4. Be authentic and transparent: Authenticity is key to effective leadership. Be genuine in your interactions, admit your mistakes, and be transparent about your decision-making process. This builds trust and encourages others to follow your lead.

5. Empower and support your team: Great leaders empower their team members to take ownership and make decisions. Provide the necessary resources, guidance, and support to help your team succeed, and celebrate their achievements along the way.

6. Practice active listening: Effective leaders listen actively and empathetically. Create an environment where everyone's voice is heard and valued, and encourage open and honest communication.

7. Lead with empathy and compassion: Show genuine care and concern for your team members. Understand their individual strengths, challenges, and aspirations, and provide support and guidance accordingly.

Remember, leading by example is not about being perfect, but about consistently demonstrating your values and inspiring others to do the same. By embodying your "why" and creating a culture of purpose, you can motivate and empower your team to take action and achieve great things. [1]
