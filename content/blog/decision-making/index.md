## Rational vs Intuitive


### Rational


Rational decision making refers to the process of making choices that are logical, objective, and based on careful analysis of available information.

According to Adair, rational decision making involves several key steps. The first step is to clearly define the problem or decision that needs to be made. This involves identifying the desired outcome and understanding the underlying factors that contribute to the problem.

Once the problem has been defined, the subsequent step involves gathering pertinent information. This encompasses the collection of data, conducting thorough research, and seeking input from diverse sources. Adair underscores the significance of acquiring precise and dependable information to guarantee well-informed decision-making.

After gathering information, the next step is to analyze and evaluate the available options. Adair suggests using techniques such as cost-benefit analysis, SWOT analysis, and decision trees to assess the potential outcomes and risks associated with each option. This analytical process helps in identifying the most viable and effective solution.

Once the options have been evaluated, the decision maker needs to make a choice. Adair emphasizes the importance of considering both the short-term and long-term consequences of the decision, as well as the potential impact on stakeholders. The decision should align with the overall goals and values of the individual or organization.

Adair emphasizes the crucial role of implementing and evaluating the decision, underscoring its significance. This entails putting the selected solution into practice and closely monitoring its efficacy. If needed, modifications can be introduced to guarantee the attainment of the desired results.

### Intuitive


Intuitive decision making refers to the process of making decisions based on instinct, gut feelings, or hunches, rather than relying solely on logical analysis or extensive data.

In the book, Adair highlights that intuitive decision making can be a valuable approach in certain situations. It can be particularly useful when faced with complex or ambiguous problems where there is limited time or information available. Intuition allows individuals to tap into their subconscious knowledge and experiences, enabling them to quickly assess a situation and make a decision without going through a lengthy analytical process.

Adair also emphasizes that intuitive decision making is not purely based on guesswork or random thoughts. It is often the result of years of experience, expertise, and pattern recognition. Through repeated exposure to similar situations, individuals develop a "gut feeling" or intuition that guides their decision-making process.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that intuitive decision making is far from infallible. Adair strongly warns against placing complete trust in intuition, as it can introduce biases, mistakes, and illogical choices. Consequently, it becomes imperative to strike a balance between intuition and critical thinking, incorporating analytical approaches into the decision-making process. Adair proposes that a synergistic blend of both intuitive and analytical methods can yield superior outcomes.

In the book 'Decision Making and Problem Solving Strategies' by J.E. Adair, intuitive decision making is highlighted as a valuable strategy. This approach involves relying on instinct, gut feelings, and past experiences to make decisions. Although it can be beneficial in specific circumstances, it is crucial to strike a balance between intuition and critical thinking to achieve more precise and rational decision making.

## Conclusion


Adair's book is not just a mere guide; it is a captivating tale that keeps readers engaged from start to finish. The author's ability to blend theory with practical examples ensures that readers can apply these strategies in their own lives, transforming them into decision-making virtuosos.

I can recommend it to anyone who can look at decision making process armed with a bit of theoretical knowledge and old good common sense.
