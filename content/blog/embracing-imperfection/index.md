“Almost everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, scared, and yet designed for joy. Even (or especially) people who seem to have it more or less together are more like the rest of us than you would believe. I try not to compare my insides to their outsides, because this makes me much worse than I already am, and if I get to know them, they turn out to have plenty of irritability and shadow of their own. Besides, those few people who aren’t a mess are probably good for about twenty minutes of dinner conversation.
This is good news, that almost everyone is petty, narcissistic, secretly insecure, and in it for themselves, because a few of the funny ones may actually long to be friends with you and me. They can be real with us, the greatest relief. As we develop love, appreciation, and forgiveness for others over time, we may accidentally develop those things toward ourselves, too.”"

Author Anne Lamott on imperfection:
“Almost everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, scared, and yet designed for joy. Even (or especially) people who seem to have it more or less together are more like the rest of us than you would believe. I try not to compare my insides to their outsides, because this makes me much worse than I already am, and if I get to know them, they turn out to have plenty of irritability and shadow of their own. Besides, those few people who aren’t a mess are probably good for about twenty minutes of dinner conversation.
This is good news, that almost everyone is petty, narcissistic, secretly insecure, and in it for themselves, because a few of the funny ones may actually long to be friends with you and me. They can be real with us, the greatest relief. As we develop love, appreciation, and forgiveness for others over time, we may accidentally develop those things toward ourselves, too. [1]

## The outcomes


>Almost everything will work if you unplug it for a few minutes...including you. [1]

The author wants to highlight the fact that imperfection is something that is natural for all humans. It is important for us to embrace our flaws and acknowledge our mistakes as they play a crucial role in our personal development and overall happiness.

According to Lamott, embracing imperfection entails recognizing that life is untidy and capricious. She urges readers to release the pursuit of flawlessness and instead embrace the allure of imperfections. By doing so, we can nurture self-compassion and foster a more genuine and empathetic perception of ourselves and others.

Lamott also highlights the importance of embracing imperfection in our relationships. She suggests that accepting the flaws and imperfections of our loved ones can lead to deeper connections and more authentic relationships. By letting go of unrealistic expectations and embracing the imperfect nature of ourselves and others, we can foster greater understanding, empathy, and acceptance.

Moreover, Lamott underscores the importance of embracing imperfection, highlighting that it does not equate to accepting mediocrity or complacency. Rather, it involves acknowledging the unattainability of perfection and understanding that pursuing it can have negative effects on our overall well-being. Through embracing imperfection, we liberate ourselves from the relentless pursuit of flawlessness and redirect our attention towards personal development, gaining wisdom from our errors, and discovering happiness in the process.

The main outcomes from the book "Almost Everything" by Anne Lamott are:

1. Embracing Imperfection: Lamott emphasizes the importance of accepting our flaws and imperfections, and finding beauty in the messiness of life. She encourages readers to let go of the need for perfection and instead focus on self-compassion and self-acceptance.

>“Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft. I think perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough, hitting each stepping-stone just right, you won't have to die. The truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who aren't even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you, and have a lot more fun while they're doing it.” [2]

Lamott explores the concept that life is untidy and imperfect, and encourages us to accept our flaws and imperfections.

One way this theme is evident is through Lamott's personal anecdotes and reflections. She shares her own struggles and insecurities, highlighting her imperfections and the mistakes she has made. Through her honest and vulnerable storytelling, Lamott encourages readers to accept their own imperfections and find beauty in the messiness of life.

In addition, Lamott places great emphasis on the significance of self-compassion and forgiveness. She acknowledges that every individual is prone to making mistakes and experiencing moments of vulnerability. However, Lamott believes that it is our response to these flaws that truly defines us. She urges readers to cultivate self-acceptance and to treat themselves with kindness, even in moments when they fail to meet their own expectations.

Furthermore, the theme of imperfection is also explored in the relationships depicted in the book. Lamott portrays flawed and complex characters who struggle with their own imperfections and make mistakes in their interactions with others. Through these relationships, Lamott highlights the messy and imperfect nature of human connections, emphasizing the importance of forgiveness, understanding, and acceptance.

>“Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up.” [2]
